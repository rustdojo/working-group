# working-group

Welcome to Rust Dojo! The idea is to create a enable collaboration of willing community members acting as mentors and mentees who want to grow. Collaboration will have a form of projects hosted in this org. Initial steps for enabling this would be to create template projects, repos and architectures for imaginary products. These repos/projects will be forked per each run and people will work on them til completion. The end result should be a finished product that meets the requirements set out by initial architecture doc. The `product` could be anything from the `coffeeshop`, `social media platform` or similar system design tasks. It could even be a `rube goldberg` machine that does absolutely nothing. The idea is to practice in collaboration and transforming architectural docs/diagrams into living functional Rust code.

## TODO

- [ ] Create template repos for rust apps
- [ ] Create template projects
- [ ] Populate `product` [repo](https://github.com/rustdojo/products) with architecture docs and design docs
